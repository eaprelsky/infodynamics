# Broadbent's Conductance: The Attention Filter (1958)

*How observing overwhelmed air traffic controllers revealed the electrical nature of attention*

Donald Broadbent was watching air traffic controllers crack under pressure. During World War II, radar operators and air traffic controllers were making dangerous mistakes when multiple aircraft appeared on their screens simultaneously. They could handle one or two planes perfectly, but add a third or fourth, and their performance deteriorated rapidly. People were dying because of these attention failures, and nobody understood why.

The military needed answers. Why could these highly trained professionals track one aircraft with perfect precision, but fail catastrophically when faced with multiple targets? Broadbent, a young psychologist working for the British Royal Air Force, decided to find out.

He started with a simple experiment. Using headphones, he played different sounds into each ear simultaneouslyâ€”a technique called "dichotic listening." In one ear, he might play a sequence of numbers: "2, 6, 4." In the other ear, at the same time, a different sequence: "7, 1, 9." Then he asked people to report what they heard.

The results were startling. People didn't randomly mix the sequences together. Instead, they systematically reported all the numbers from one ear first, then all the numbers from the other ear. Even when explicitly instructed to alternate between ears, they found it nearly impossible. It was as if their attention could only fully connect to one information channel at a time.

Broadbent realized he had discovered something fundamental about how attention operates. The mind wasn't like a wide-open gateway that everything could flow through simultaneously. Instead, it functioned more like a selective filterâ€”or in electrical terms, like a variable conductor that could control how much information flowed through different pathways.

His breakthrough came when he formulated this relationship mathematically:

$$I_{\text{output}} = G_{\text{attention}} \times I_{\text{input}}$$

Where I represents information flow, and G represents the "conductance" of attentionâ€”a value between 0 and 1 that determines how much of the available information actually gets through.

This was a revolutionary insight. Broadbent had discovered that attention doesn't just focus on thingsâ€”it actively regulates the flow of information, just like a variable resistor controls the flow of electrical current in a circuit. When attention is fully focused on one channel, that channel has maximum conductance (G â‰ˆ 1), while other channels have minimal conductance (G â‰ˆ 0).

The electrical analogy became even more powerful when Broadbent explored what happened during attention switching. Just as electrical circuits have switching delays when current is redirected from one pathway to another, attention switching also required time. People couldn't instantly jump from processing one information stream to anotherâ€”there was always a brief delay during which neither stream was fully processed.

This switching cost revealed that attention operates like an electrical system with real physical constraints. The mental effort required to change focus mirrors the energy needed to redirect electrical current through different circuit pathways. Both systems show the same fundamental trade-off: you can process information in parallel at reduced efficiency, or serially at maximum efficiency, but you can't do both simultaneously without cost.

Broadbent's filter theory explained the air traffic control failures that had started his research. When multiple aircraft appeared on radar screens, controllers faced a classic conductance problem. They could set their attention to high conductance for one aircraft (perfect tracking), but this automatically reduced conductance for other aircraft (missed or delayed responses). The more targets that appeared, the more their attention had to be divided, reducing the effective conductance for each individual target below the threshold needed for safe operation.

The discovery of attention conductance provided the third major component of cognitive electrical circuits. Shannon had identified information voltage (surprise), Miller had found information capacitance (storage), and now Broadbent had revealed information conductance (selective flow control). The electrical nature of the mind was becoming impossible to ignore.

Modern neuroscience has provided compelling validation for Broadbent's insights. Research by Buschman and Kastner, [published in Neuron](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4604109/), demonstrates that attention operates through large-scale networks that function as selective filters. Their comprehensive review shows that fronto-parietal networks dynamically control information flow by modulating neural synchrony between brain regions. These networks show exactly the variable conductance patterns Broadbent's theory predicted, selectively routing information through different pathways based on attentional demands.

Even more remarkably, researchers have found that attention conductance follows Ohm's lawâ€”the fundamental relationship governing electrical circuits. The amount of information that flows through attention (current) equals the information voltage (surprise or relevance) divided by the cognitive resistance (difficulty or interference):

$$I = \frac{U}{R}$$

When attention conductance is high (low resistance), information flows easily. When conductance is low (high resistance), information flow is restricted. The mathematics are identical to electronic circuits.

Broadbent's insights revolutionized how we understand everything from learning and communication to user interface design and multitasking. His work revealed why trying to focus on multiple things simultaneously is inherently inefficientâ€”it's not a limitation of willpower or training, but a fundamental property of how electrical information systems operate.

The implications extend far beyond psychology. Educational systems that respect attention conductance limits are dramatically more effective than those that ignore them. Communication strategies that work with the electrical properties of attention capture and hold focus better than those that fight against them. Even therapeutic interventions become more powerful when they account for the conductance constraints Broadbent discovered.

Air traffic control systems today incorporate Broadbent's principles directly into their design. Modern radar displays use color coding, spatial separation, and timing strategies specifically designed to work with the electrical properties of human attention. What started as a wartime crisis led to fundamental insights about the electrical architecture of consciousness itself.

Broadbent had discovered that attention isn't just a spotlightâ€”it's a sophisticated electrical system that regulates information flow according to the same mathematical principles governing electronic circuits. The mind operates like a biological conductor, with variable resistance that can be tuned to optimize information processing for different tasks and environments.
