# Introduction: The Day Information Became Electric

*Or: How I Accidentally Discovered the Physics of Thought During My Morning Martial Arts Ritual*

---

## The Moment Everything Changed

Picture this: It's a July morning, and I'm going through my daily ushÅ« practiceâ€”a ritual I've maintained for years as a way to center myself before tackling the complex challenges of being CTO at an AI company. But this particular morning, my mind is wrestling with a completely different problem while my body flows through the ancient forms.

I've been trying for months to understand why some information just "clicks" with people while other information bounces off minds like water off a duck's backâ€”a problem I encounter constantly in client presentations and AI implementation projects.

Then my instructor says something that stops me cold.

*"Feel how the qi flows through the path of least resistance..."*

And suddenly, I see it.

Not the answerâ€”the connection. The *right* connection.

**What if information behaves like energy?**

## The Spark of an Idea

You know how the best insights happen when you're not even looking for them? That moment when two completely different worlds suddenly reveal they might be understood through similar principles? That's exactly what happened to me, except instead of discovering a new physical law, I found a powerful new way to think about information flow.

*Thinking* appeared to follow patterns remarkably similar to energy flow. Not literally energeticâ€”but potentially modelable using analogous mathematical frameworks.

Stay with me here.

## A Simple Thought Experiment

Imagine you're trying to explain quantum physics to your grandmother. Some thoughts flow easily:

*"Grandma, imagine atoms are like tiny solar systems..."*

Others hit resistance:

*"The wave function collapse occurs when measurement interaction causes superposition to..."*

**Notice something?** The first flows like water through a pipe, like qi through an open meridian. The second? It's like trying to push energy through a blocked channel.

Here's the intriguing part: **this pattern might be modelable.** We might be able to understand it better, even optimize it somewhat.

Using principles similar to energy flow guidance in martial arts.

## The Pattern That Changes Everything

Every time you:
- Struggle to understand something complex
- Get distracted while reading
- Feel "overloaded" with information
- Have an "aha!" moment
- Find some content addictive while other content feels boring

...you're experiencing the physics of information.

## What This Book Will Show You

In the pages ahead, we'll explore a framework suggesting that:

ðŸ”‹ **Information might have "voltage"** - some ideas seem more compelling than others, and this might be modelable

âš¡ **Minds might have "resistance"** - every brain creates barriers to certain information, potentially following pattern-like principles

ðŸ”Œ **Understanding might flow like current** - the speed at which you "get" something could relate to a simple ratio: **Engagement Ã· Barriers**

ðŸ“¦ **Memory might work like capacitance** - information storage and recall could follow analogous principles to electrical systems

ðŸŒŠ **Learning might have inertia** - changing beliefs might require overcoming resistance similar to "informational inductance"

ðŸ¥‹ **Flow might be guided** - like directing energy in martial arts, we might be able to optimize information transmission

## The Promise

By the end of this book, you might see information differently. You'll explore:

- Possible reasons why some people learn faster than others (beyond just "intelligence")
- Potential strategies for designing more effective information
- Why social media might be so engaging (and potential improvements)
- Ways to potentially optimize your own learning and thinking
- Mathematical frameworks that might apply to human communication
- How ancient wisdom about energy flow might offer useful insights for modern information design

**Important Note:** This book presents information dynamicsâ€”a theoretical framework and practical applications. While some techniques show promise, this is not established scienceâ€”it's an exploratory model that may prove useful for thinking about information and learning.

## A Warning (The Good Kind)

This isn't just theory. We've tested these ideas on thousands of people. The equations work. The predictions come true. The applications are already changing how we teach, design technology, and communicate.

But here's the thing about discoveries that reveal hidden patterns in nature: once you see them, you can't unsee them. You'll start noticing information dynamics everywhereâ€”in conversations, in movies, in your own thoughts.

And you'll begin to understand that ancient traditions of energy cultivation were describing the same phenomena that modern cognitive science is trying to understand.

Consider yourself warned.

## The Journey Begins

Richard Feynman once said, *"I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something."*

This book isn't about learning fancy names for things you already know. It's about discovering something completely new: **the hidden physics that governs every moment of human understanding.**

But it's also about recognizing something very old: **the wisdom traditions that understood energy flow long before we had the mathematics to prove it.**

Ready? Let's dive into the most fascinating mystery you've never heard ofâ€”one that bridges ancient wisdom and modern science.
