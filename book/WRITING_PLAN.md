## üé® Writing Style Guidelines

### **Feynman-Inspired Principles:**

1. **Start with wonder:** Every chapter begins with a mystery or puzzle
2. **Use analogies:** Electrical concepts explained through familiar experiences
3. **Tell stories:** Historical anecdotes, personal experiences, case studies
4. **Make math beautiful:** LaTeX equations with clear explanations
5. **End with insight:** Each chapter should change how readers see the world

### **Language Patterns:**

**‚úÖ Good:**
- "Have you ever wondered why..."
- "Here's the crazy part..."
- "Picture this scenario..."
- "The beautiful thing about this is..."
- "What this means for you..."

**‚ùå Avoid:**
- Academic jargon without explanation
- Passive voice
- Abstract concepts without concrete examples
- Math without intuitive meaning
