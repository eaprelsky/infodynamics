## Introduction to the Mathematics

This appendix provides the mathematical derivations underlying the information dynamics framework presented in the main book. While the framework uses electrical analogies metaphorically, the mathematics can be useful for modeling and predicting cognitive phenomena.

**Important Note:** These derivations represent mathematical models that may be useful for understanding cognitive processes, not discovered laws of physics. They should be interpreted as potentially useful frameworks rather than established scientific principles.

## A.1 Fundamental Information Flow Equation

### **Derivation of Ohm's Law for Information**

Starting with the basic assumption that information flow might be analogous to electrical current:

**Given:**
- Information "voltage" $U_{info}$ represents the driving force for information processing
- Information "resistance" $R_{info}$ represents barriers to information flow
- Information "current" $I_{info}$ represents the rate of information processing

**Basic Relationship:**
If information flow follows patterns similar to electrical flow, then:

$$I_{info} = \frac{U_{info}}{R_{info}}$$

**Derivation from First Principles:**

Let's assume information processing rate depends on:
1. The "driving force" of information (voltage-like quantity)
2. The "barriers" to processing (resistance-like quantity)

For a linear relationship (first-order approximation):

$$\frac{dQ_{info}}{dt} = k \cdot \frac{F_{driving}}{B_{barriers}}$$

Where:
- $Q_{info}$ = accumulated information
- $F_{driving}$ = driving force for information processing
- $B_{barriers}$ = barriers to information flow
- $k$ = proportionality constant

Defining:
- $I_{info} = \frac{dQ_{info}}{dt}$ (information current)
- $U_{info} = k \cdot F_{driving}$ (information voltage)
- $R_{info} = \frac{B_{barriers}}{k}$ (information resistance)

We obtain: $$I_{info} = \frac{U_{info}}{R_{info}}$$

## A.2 Information Voltage Components

### **Multi-Component Voltage Model**

Information voltage emerges from multiple sources that combine to create total driving force:

$$U_{info} = U_{surprise} + U_{emotion} + U_{relevance} + U_{novelty}$$

**Surprise Voltage Derivation:**

Based on information theory, surprise is inversely related to probability:

$$U_{surprise} = -k_s \log_2 P(\text{information})$$

Where:
- $P(\text{information})$ = probability of the information occurring
- $k_s$ = surprise scaling constant

**Derivation:**
From Shannon's information theory, the information content of an event is:
$$I = -\log_2 P(\text{event})$$

For cognitive processing, we hypothesize that surprise voltage is proportional to information content:
$$U_{surprise} = k_s \cdot I = -k_s \log_2 P(\text{information})$$

**Emotional Voltage Model:**

Building on Russell's (1980) circumplex model of affect, emotional voltage depends on the two fundamental dimensions of emotion: arousal and valence.

$$U_{emotion} = k_e \cdot A_{arousal} \cdot V_{valence}$$

Where:
- $A_{arousal}$ = emotional arousal level (0 to 1), based on Russell's arousal dimension
- $V_{valence}$ = emotional valence (-1 to +1), based on Russell's valence dimension  
- $k_e$ = emotional scaling constant

**Theoretical Foundation:** This formulation directly implements Russell's (1980) circumplex model of affect, which established arousal and valence as the two fundamental dimensions underlying all emotional experience. Extensive research (Bradley & Lang, 1994; Posner et al., 2005; Barrett, 2017) has validated these dimensions as neurobiologically distinct and measurable components of affective processing.

**Relevance Voltage Model:**

Relevance might be modeled as the overlap between information content and current cognitive priorities:

$$U_{relevance} = k_r \cdot \sum_{i} w_i \cdot S_i$$

Where:
- $w_i$ = weight of cognitive priority $i$
- $S_i$ = similarity between information and priority $i$
- $k_r$ = relevance scaling constant

## A.3 Information Resistance Components

### **Multi-Factor Resistance Model**

Total information resistance combines multiple barrier types:

$$R_{info} = R_{complexity} + R_{contradiction} + R_{overload} + R_{attention}$$

**Complexity Resistance:**

Complexity resistance might increase exponentially with information complexity:

$$R_{complexity} = R_0 \cdot e^{\alpha \cdot C_{complexity}}$$

Where:
- $R_0$ = baseline resistance
- $\alpha$ = complexity scaling parameter
- $C_{complexity}$ = complexity measure

**Derivation:**
Assuming cognitive load increases exponentially with complexity (consistent with cognitive load theory), and resistance is proportional to cognitive load:

$$\text{Cognitive Load} = L_0 \cdot e^{\alpha \cdot C}$$
$$R_{complexity} = k \cdot \text{Cognitive Load} = R_0 \cdot e^{\alpha \cdot C}$$

**Contradiction Resistance:**

When new information contradicts existing beliefs, resistance might follow:

$$R_{contradiction} = R_{base} \cdot (1 + \beta \cdot D_{contradiction}^2)$$

Where:
- $D_{contradiction}$ = degree of contradiction with existing beliefs
- $\beta$ = contradiction sensitivity parameter

## A.4 Dynamic Circuit Equations

### **Information Capacitance Model**

Information capacitance represents the ability to store and maintain information:

$$C_{info} = \frac{Q_{stored}}{U_{stored}}$$

Where:
- $Q_{stored}$ = amount of information stored
- $U_{stored}$ = "voltage" required to maintain that information

**Working Memory Capacitance:**

Based on Miller's 7±2 limit and decay characteristics:

$$C_{working} = C_{max} \cdot e^{-t/\tau} \cdot (1 - \frac{n}{n_{max}})$$

Where:
- $C_{max}$ = maximum working memory capacity
- $\tau$ = decay time constant
- $n$ = current number of stored items
- $n_{max}$ = maximum number of items (≈ 7)

### **Information Inductance Model**

Information inductance represents resistance to changes in information flow:

$$L_{info} = -\frac{dU_{info}}{dI_{info}/dt}$$

**Belief Inductance:**

Strong existing beliefs create inductance that resists changes in information processing:

$$L_{belief} = L_0 \cdot (1 + \gamma \cdot S_{belief}^2)$$

Where:
- $S_{belief}$ = strength of existing belief
- $\gamma$ = belief rigidity parameter

## A.5 Network Analysis: Kirchhoff's Laws

### **Information Current Law (ICL)**

At any cognitive processing node, information flow must be conserved:

$$\sum_{i} I_{in,i} = \sum_{j} I_{out,j} + \frac{dQ_{node}}{dt}$$

**Derivation:**
Assuming information cannot be created or destroyed at processing nodes (conservation principle), the rate of information accumulation equals the difference between inflow and outflow:

$$\frac{dQ_{node}}{dt} = \sum_{i} I_{in,i} - \sum_{j} I_{out,j}$$

Rearranging: $$\sum_{i} I_{in,i} = \sum_{j} I_{out,j} + \frac{dQ_{node}}{dt}$$

### **Information Voltage Law (IVL)**

Around any closed loop in an information processing network:

$$\sum_{k} U_{source,k} = \sum_{l} I_l \cdot R_l$$

**Derivation:**
For conservative information processing (no energy loss), the total driving voltage around any closed loop must equal the total voltage drops across resistive elements.

## A.6 System Dynamics

### **Complete Dynamic System**

The full information dynamics system can be described by coupled differential equations:

$$\frac{dI_{info}}{dt} = \frac{1}{L_{info}} \left[ U_{info}(t) - R_{info}(t) \cdot I_{info}(t) - \frac{Q_{info}(t)}{C_{info}(t)} \right]$$

$$\frac{dQ_{info}}{dt} = I_{info}(t)$$

**Parameter Evolution:**

The circuit parameters themselves evolve based on system state:

$$\frac{dR_{info}}{dt} = f_R(I_{info}, Q_{info}, \text{context})$$

$$\frac{dC_{info}}{dt} = f_C(I_{info}, Q_{info}, \text{attention})$$

$$\frac{dL_{info}}{dt} = f_L(I_{info}, Q_{info}, \text{beliefs})$$

## A.7 Statistical Mechanics Approach

### **Information Processing as Statistical System**

For large-scale cognitive systems, we can apply statistical mechanics principles:

**Partition Function:**
$$Z = \sum_{\text{states}} e^{-E_{\text{state}}/k_B T_{cognitive}}$$

Where $T_{cognitive}$ represents "cognitive temperature" (processing intensity).

**Average Information Processing Rate:**
$$\langle I_{info} \rangle = \frac{1}{Z} \sum_{\text{states}} I_{\text{state}} \cdot e^{-E_{\text{state}}/k_B T_{cognitive}}$$

## A.8 Frequency Domain Analysis

### **Information Processing Spectra**

Different types of information processing occur at different characteristic frequencies:

**Attention Frequencies:** 8-15 Hz (alpha brain waves)
**Working Memory:** 4-8 Hz (theta waves)  
**Long-term Processing:** 0.1-4 Hz (delta waves)

**Transfer Function:**

$$H(\omega) = \frac{I_{info}(\omega)}{U_{info}(\omega)} = \frac{1}{R_{info} + j\omega L_{info} + \frac{1}{j\omega C_{info}}}$$

**Resonance Frequency:**
$$\omega_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{L_{info} \cdot C_{info}}}$$

## A.9 Optimization Theory

### **Maximum Information Flow**

To maximize information processing efficiency, we need to optimize:

$$\max_{U,R,L,C} \int_0^T I_{info}(t) dt$$

Subject to constraints:
- Energy limitations: $\int_0^T P_{info}(t) dt \leq E_{available}$
- Cognitive capacity: $Q_{info}(t) \leq Q_{max}$
- Processing limits: $I_{info}(t) \leq I_{max}$

**Lagrangian Approach:**
$$\mathcal{L} = I_{info} + \lambda_1(E_{available} - P_{info}) + \lambda_2(Q_{max} - Q_{info}) + \lambda_3(I_{max} - I_{info})$$

## A.10 Validation and Testing

### **Model Predictions**

The mathematical framework generates testable predictions:

1. **Response Time Prediction:**
   $$RT = k \cdot R_{info} + \text{baseline}$$

2. **Learning Rate Prediction:**
   $$LR = \frac{k \cdot U_{info}}{R_{info} \cdot C_{info}}$$

3. **Memory Retention:**
   $$M(t) = M_0 \cdot e^{-t/\tau} \quad \text{where} \quad \tau = R_{info} \cdot C_{info}$$

### **Parameter Estimation**

Parameters can be estimated from behavioral data using:

**Maximum Likelihood Estimation:**
$$\hat{\theta} = \arg\max_\theta \sum_i \log P(data_i | \theta)$$

**Bayesian Inference:**
$$P(\theta | data) \propto P(data | \theta) \cdot P(\theta)$$

2. **Stationarity:** Parameters assumed stable over short time periods
