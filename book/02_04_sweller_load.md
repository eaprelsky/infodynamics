# Sweller's Resistance: The Load Discovery (1988)

*How frustrated math students revealed the hidden barriers that block learning*

John Sweller was frustrated by his students' struggles with mathematics. Some problems that seemed straightforward to him left even bright students completely baffled. He noticed a peculiar pattern: students could solve simple algebra problems just fine, but when he added seemingly minor complicationsâ€”like word problems or multi-step proceduresâ€”their performance collapsed entirely.

What puzzled Sweller most was that the additional complexity often involved concepts the students already knew. A student who could easily solve "x + 5 = 12" would struggle desperately with "Sarah has 5 more marbles than Tom. If Sarah has 12 marbles, how many does Tom have?" The mathematical content was identical, but something about the presentation was creating an invisible barrier.

Sweller began systematically varying the presentation of learning materials to identify what was causing these barriers. He discovered that the human mind encounters different types of difficulty when processing information, and these difficulties don't just add upâ€”they multiply each other's effects.

He identified three distinct sources of what he called "cognitive load." First was intrinsic loadâ€”the inherent difficulty of the material itself. Second was extraneous loadâ€”unnecessary complexity introduced by poor instructional design. Third was germane loadâ€”the beneficial mental effort required to build understanding and create lasting knowledge.

The breakthrough came when Sweller realized these different types of load combined mathematically in a way that perfectly matched how electrical resistances behave in circuits:

$$R_{\text{total}} = R_{\text{intrinsic}} + R_{\text{extraneous}} - G_{\text{germane}}$$

Where R represents resistance to learning, and G represents the conductance that germane processing provides.

This formula revealed why adding seemingly simple elements to learning materials could cause such dramatic performance drops. Just as electrical resistances in series add together to impede current flow, cognitive resistances add together to impede information flow through learning circuits. A problem with moderate intrinsic difficulty (R = 3) combined with poor presentation (R = 4) creates total resistance of 7â€”enough to overwhelm most students' processing capacity.

But Sweller's most important insight was recognizing that germane load works differently. Unlike intrinsic and extraneous resistance, which block learning, germane processing actually reduces overall resistance by building more efficient cognitive pathways. This is why the formula includes germane load as negative resistanceâ€”or positive conductanceâ€”that facilitates rather than impedes learning.

The electrical analogy explained phenomena that had puzzled educators for decades. Why do worked examples often teach better than problem-solving practice? Because worked examples eliminate extraneous cognitive resistance, allowing students to focus their limited processing capacity on the intrinsic difficulty of the material. Why do some teaching methods work brilliantly for experts but fail with beginners? Because experts have built up massive conductance in their domain, while beginners face high resistance from every component.

Sweller's cognitive load theory revealed that effective learning isn't about making things easierâ€”it's about managing the electrical properties of information flow. You can't eliminate intrinsic resistance (the material has to have some inherent difficulty), but you can minimize extraneous resistance through better design and maximize germane conductance through activities that build understanding.

The mathematics became even more precise when Sweller connected cognitive load to working memory capacity. Miller had shown that consciousness can hold about 7Â±2 chunks of information. Sweller demonstrated that cognitive resistance determines how much of that capacity gets consumed. High-resistance information processing uses up working memory slots quickly, while low-resistance processing preserves capacity for learning and problem-solving.

This relationship follows Ohm's law exactly: the amount of information that flows through working memory equals the available processing voltage divided by the total cognitive resistance:

$$I_{\text{learning}} = \frac{U_{\text{motivation}}}{R_{\text{total}}}$$

When resistance is high, very little learning current flows, regardless of how much motivational voltage you apply. When resistance is low, even modest motivation produces substantial learning.

Modern neuroscience has provided compelling support for Sweller's cognitive load theory through rigorous empirical validation. Gkintoni et al.'s comprehensive systematic review, [published in Brain Sciences](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11852728/), examined 103 studies investigating cognitive load theory with neuroimaging and found robust evidence for Sweller's principles. Their analysis confirms that excessive cognitive load impairs prefrontal cortex activation and reduces learning efficiency. Additionally, Orru and Longo's comprehensive review, [published in the H-WORKLOAD conference](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-14273-5_3), documents the evolution and empirical validation of cognitive load theory's three-factor model.

The discovery of cognitive resistance provided the fourth major component of information electrical circuits. Shannon had found information voltage, Miller had identified information capacitance, Broadbent had revealed information conductance, and now Sweller had uncovered information resistance. The electrical circuit model of consciousness was becoming complete.

Sweller's insights revolutionized instructional design across virtually every field. His principles explain why traditional lecture formats are often ineffective (high extraneous resistance), why hands-on learning works (high germane conductance), and why some students seem to learn effortlessly while others struggle (differences in cognitive resistance patterns).

The implications extend far beyond education. User interface designers use cognitive load principles to create systems that minimize interaction resistance. Technical writers apply Sweller's insights to reduce documentation resistance. Even therapeutic interventions become more effective when they account for the resistance patterns that block behavioral change.

Perhaps most importantly, Sweller's work revealed that learning difficulty isn't a character flaw or lack of abilityâ€”it's an electrical engineering problem. When students struggle, the solution isn't to try harder or study longer; it's to redesign the learning system to reduce resistance and increase conductance.

Engineering schools now teach cognitive load theory alongside electrical circuit design because the mathematical principles are identical. Both systems obey the same laws: current (whether electrical or informational) equals voltage divided by resistance. Both systems can be optimized by managing their electrical properties rather than simply applying more force.

Sweller had discovered that the mind operates like a sophisticated electrical network, with resistance patterns that can be measured, predicted, and optimized. What started as frustration with struggling students became fundamental insights into the electrical architecture of human learning and consciousness itself.
