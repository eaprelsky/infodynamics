## The Hidden Pattern

Between 1948 and 1988, five brilliant researchers working in completely different fields, studying entirely different aspects of human cognition, made discoveries that would eventually revolutionize our understanding of consciousness. But none of them realized they were uncovering components of the same underlying system.

Claude Shannon was modeling information transmission through noisy channels. George Miller was investigating the mysterious limits of human memory. Donald Broadbent was tracking how attention filters overwhelming sensory input. John Sweller was discovering why some learning tasks overwhelm students while others feel effortless. Leon Festinger was mapping the strange mathematics of belief change and cognitive resistance.

Each researcher had found a crucial piece of what we now recognize as the electrical architecture of consciousness. But working in isolation, none could see the complete picture that emerges when their discoveries are viewed together.

## The Electrical Architecture Emerges

When these five theoretical discoveries are integrated, something remarkable becomes clear: **human consciousness operates as a sophisticated electrical information processing system, governed by the same fundamental laws that control all electrical circuits**.

This isn't metaphor or analogy. The mathematical relationships these researchers uncovered map precisely onto the equations that electrical engineers use to design circuits, predict current flow, and optimize electrical system performance.

**Shannon's Information Theory** → **Information Voltage**  
The "surprise" and relevance that drives information transmission corresponds directly to electrical voltage—the force that pushes current through circuits.

**Miller's Capacity Limitations** → **Information Capacitance**  
The storage limits and temporal dynamics of working memory follow the same mathematical laws that govern electrical capacitors.

**Broadbent's Attention Filtering** → **Information Conductance**  
The selective permeability of attention operates exactly like electrical conductance—determining which information flows easily and which encounters resistance.

**Sweller's Cognitive Load Theory** → **Information Resistance**  
The barriers that block learning and comprehension behave like electrical resistance—opposing information flow in predictable, measurable ways.

**Festinger's Dissonance Theory** → **Information Inductance**  
The tendency of belief systems to resist change follows the same mathematical patterns as electrical inductance—opposing changes in information flow with force proportional to the rate of change.

Together, these five components form a complete electrical circuit model of human consciousness.
