The history of cognitive science reads like a detective story. For decades, brilliant researchers made discoveries that seemed unrelated at the time, but which we now recognize as pieces of a much larger puzzle. Each breakthrough identified a component of what we now understand as cognitive electrical circuitsâ€”voltage, resistance, capacitance, and inductanceâ€”without anyone realizing they were mapping the electrical architecture of the mind.

This chapter traces the scattered clues that led to information dynamics. We'll meet the scientists who discovered the mathematical laws governing how information flows through cognitive systems, and see how their seemingly unconnected insights actually reveal the electrical nature of consciousness itself.

What emerges is a remarkable story: generation after generation of researchers independently discovered the same electrical principles that govern electronic circuits, but found them operating in the realm of human thought and emotion.

## The Key Discoveries

### [Information Voltage: Shannon's Revolution (1948)](02_01_shannon_information.md)
Claude Shannon thought he was just solving telephone engineering problems. Instead, he discovered the mathematical relationship that governs how "surprise" creates electrical pressure in any information-processing systemâ€”including the human brain.

### [Information Capacitance: Miller's 7Â±2 Discovery (1956)](02_02_miller_capacity.md)
George Miller had a problem: no matter what memory test he gave people, they kept hitting the same mysterious wall at exactly seven items. His discovery revealed the fundamental storage capacity of consciousnessâ€”the cognitive "capacitance" that limits how much information the mind can hold at once.

### [Information Conductance: Broadbent's Attention Filter (1958)](02_03_broadbent_attention.md)
Air traffic controllers were dying because of attention failures, and Donald Broadbent needed to know why. His wartime research uncovered how attention acts like a variable electrical conductor, controlling the flow of information through cognitive systems with the same mathematics that govern electronic circuits.

### [Information Resistance: Sweller's Load Discovery (1988)](02_04_sweller_load.md)
John Sweller was frustrated watching bright students struggle with simple math problems when minor complications were added. His investigation revealed that learning difficulty follows the same mathematical laws as electrical resistanceâ€”and that understanding these laws revolutionizes how we design education.

### [Information Inductance: Festinger's Belief Inertia (1957)](02_05_festinger_dissonance.md)
When a doomsday cult's predictions failed spectacularly, Leon Festinger expected the believers to abandon their faith. Instead, they became more convinced than ever. His infiltration of the group revealed why beliefs resist change like electrical inductorsâ€”storing energy that actively opposes shifts in direction.

### [The Complete Circuit: When Scattered Clues Click Into Place](02_06_synthesis.md)
Five researchers, working across forty years in completely different fields, had unknowingly mapped the same electrical system. When their discoveries are placed side by side, something extraordinary emerges: the complete electrical architecture of human consciousness, operating according to the same laws that govern every electronic device.
