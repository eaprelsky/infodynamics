**Optimized Weights**: 0.38√ótemporal + 0.49√ócognitive + 0.17√ósystemic  
**Performance**: R¬≤ = 0.415  
**Key Insight**: Cognitive inductance (belief persistence) more important than temporal delays

### Model 3: Transformation Efficiency (T_eff)
**Components**: Semantic_Preservation + Factual_Density + Quality_Enhancement  
**Optimized Weights**: 0.54√ósemantic + 0.21√ófactual + 0.24√óquality
