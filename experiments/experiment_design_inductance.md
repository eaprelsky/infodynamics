## 🎯 Objective

Design and implement controlled experiments to validate the Information Inductance (L_info) model, testing its relationship with processing delays, cognitive inertia, and temporal information processing characteristics.

---

## 🔬 Experimental Overview

### **Primary Research Questions**
1. Does L_info correlate with processing delays and reaction times?
2. Can L_info predict resistance to rapid information changes?
3. Do age and cognitive flexibility affect L_info as predicted?
4. Is L_info measurable through temporal processing tasks?

### **Core Hypotheses**
- **H1:** L_info ∝ Reaction Time (r > 0.6)
- **H2:** L_info ∝ Age (r > 0.4)
- **H3:** L_info ∝ (1/Cognitive Flexibility) (r > 0.5)
- **H4:** L_info predicts task switching costs (r > 0.6)

## 📋 Experimental Design

### **Study 1: Temporal Processing and L_info**

#### **Participants**

- **Age groups:** Young (18-30), Middle (31-50), Older (51-75)
- **N per group:** 33-34 participants
- **Screening:** Normal cognition, no neurological conditions

#### **Temporal Processing Battery**

**Reaction Time Tasks:**
- **Simple RT:** Single stimulus response (baseline processing)
- **Choice RT:** 2-choice, 4-choice, 8-choice discrimination
- **Go/No-Go:** Response inhibition and initiation
- **Stop-Signal:** Response cancellation ability

**Temporal Judgment Tasks:**
- **Time Estimation:** Judge intervals 500ms-5000ms
- **Temporal Bisection:** Categorize intervals as short/long
- **Rhythm Reproduction:** Reproduce tapped rhythms
- **Temporal Order:** Judge sequence of rapid stimuli

**Information Change Detection:**
- **Change Blindness:** Detect changes in complex scenes
- **Rapid Serial Presentation:** Track targets in rapid streams
- **Attentional Blink:** Detect second target after first
- **Motion Detection:** Threshold for motion perception

#### **L_info Calculation**
```python
def calculate_L_info_experimental(participant_data):
    # Temporal inductance components
    baseline_rt = participant_data["simple_rt"]
    choice_rt_slope = participant_data["choice_rt_slope"]
    temporal_precision = participant_data["temporal_judgment_cv"]
    
    # Processing delay factor
    processing_delay = (baseline_rt - 150) / 100  # Normalize above minimum
    
    # Choice complexity effect
    complexity_effect = choice_rt_slope / 50  # ms per bit
    
    # Temporal precision (inverse)
    precision_factor = temporal_precision / 0.1  # Higher CV = higher inductance
    
    # Age factor
    age = participant_data["age"]
    age_factor = 1.0 + 0.01 * max(0, age - 20)
    
    # Combined L_info
    L_info = (0.4 * processing_delay + 
              0.3 * complexity_effect + 
              0.3 * precision_factor) * age_factor
    
    return max(0.1, min(5.0, L_info))
```

#### **Expected Results**
- **L_info range:** 0.3-4.2 across participants
- **Age correlation:** r = 0.45 ± 0.15
- **RT correlation:** r = 0.65 ± 0.15
- **Individual differences:** σ = 0.8 L_info units

### **Study 2: Cognitive Flexibility and Information Inertia**

#### **Design**
- **Mixed design:** Between-subjects (age) × Within-subjects (task switching)
- **Tasks:** Wisconsin Card Sort, Task Switching Paradigm, Set Shifting
- **Conditions:** Predictable vs. unpredictable switches

#### **Task Switching Paradigm**
- **Cue-to-target interval:** 100ms, 500ms, 1000ms
- **Switch frequency:** 25%, 50%, 75% switch trials
- **Task domains:** Number/letter classification, color/shape judgment
- **Trial types:** Repeat, switch, mixed blocks

#### **Cognitive Flexibility Measures**
- **Switch costs:** RT difference between switch and repeat trials
- **Mixing costs:** RT difference between pure and mixed blocks
- **Error rates:** Accuracy decrements with switching
- **Preparation effects:** Benefit of longer preparation time

#### **L_info Predictions**
- **High L_info:** Large switch costs, slow preparation
- **Low L_info:** Small switch costs, rapid adaptation
- **Age effects:** Increasing L_info with age
- **Individual differences:** Stable trait-like properties

#### **Analysis Plan**
```python
# Switch cost calculation
switch_cost = rt_switch_trials - rt_repeat_trials

# L_info correlation with switch costs
correlation = pearsonr(L_info_scores, switch_costs)

# Age mediation analysis
mediation_model = mediation_analysis(
    X="age", 
    M="L_info", 
    Y="switch_cost", 
    data=experiment_data
)
```

### **Study 3: Information Frequency Response**

#### **Rationale**
L_info should show frequency-dependent effects, with higher resistance to rapid information changes (high frequency) compared to slow changes (low frequency).

#### **Experimental Manipulation**
- **Information rate:** 0.5 Hz, 1 Hz, 2 Hz, 4 Hz, 8 Hz
- **Task:** Continuous performance with changing rules
- **Measure:** Adaptation time to rule changes
- **Duration:** 5-minute blocks per frequency condition

#### **Frequency Response Prediction**
```python
def predict_frequency_response(L_info, frequency_hz):
    # Inductive reactance increases with frequency
    omega = 2 * np.pi * frequency_hz
    X_L = omega * L_info
    
    # Response difficulty proportional to reactance
    adaptation_time = 1.0 + X_L  # seconds
    error_rate = 0.05 + 0.1 * X_L  # base + frequency effect
    
    return {
        "adaptation_time": adaptation_time,
        "error_rate": min(0.5, error_rate),
        "reactance": X_L
    }
```

#### **Expected Pattern**
- **Low frequency (0.5-1 Hz):** Good adaptation, low errors
- **Medium frequency (2-4 Hz):** Moderate difficulty
- **High frequency (8+ Hz):** Poor adaptation, high errors
- **Individual differences:** Higher L_info = steeper frequency effects
