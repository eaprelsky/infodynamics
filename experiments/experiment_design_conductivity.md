**Development Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** 🔬 IN DEVELOPMENT  
**Phase:** Experimental design and protocol development

---

## 🎯 Objective

Design and implement controlled experiments to validate the Information Conductivity (G_info) model, testing its relationship with attention, cognitive capacity, and information processing efficiency.

---

## 🔬 Experimental Overview

### **Primary Research Questions**
1. Does G_info correlate with attention and working memory measures?
2. Can G_info predict information processing performance?
3. Do individual differences in G_info match theoretical predictions?
4. Is G_info stable across different information types and contexts?

### **Core Hypotheses**
- **H1:** G_info ∝ Working Memory Capacity (r > 0.6)
- **H2:** G_info ∝ Attention Control (r > 0.5)  
- **H3:** G_info predicts multitasking performance (r > 0.7)
- **H4:** G_info varies systematically with cognitive load (β > 0.4)

## 📊 Data Analysis Plan

### **Statistical Approaches**

#### **Correlation Analysis**
```python
# Primary validation correlations
correlations = {
    "working_memory": pearsonr(g_info_scores, wm_scores),
    "attention_control": pearsonr(g_info_scores, attention_scores),
    "processing_speed": pearsonr(g_info_scores, speed_scores),
    "fluid_intelligence": pearsonr(g_info_scores, intelligence_scores)
}
```

#### **Regression Modeling**
```python
# Multiple regression predicting G_info
model = LinearRegression()
predictors = ["working_memory", "attention", "processing_speed", "age", "education"]
model.fit(X[predictors], y["g_info"])

# Report R², coefficients, and significance
```

#### **Mixed-Effects Models**
```python
# Longitudinal analysis with random effects
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Model G_info changes over time with individual random effects
model = sm.MixedLM.from_formula(
    "g_info ~ time + training + time*training", 
    data=longitudinal_data,
    groups=longitudinal_data["participant_id"]
)
```

### **Power Analysis**
- **Effect size expectations:** r = 0.5 (medium-large)
- **Alpha level:** 0.05
- **Desired power:** 0.80
- **Required N:** 84 (increased to 120 for dropouts)

### **Data Quality Checks**
- **Outlier detection:** z-scores > 3.0 flagged for review
- **Missing data:** Maximum 10% missing per participant
- **Reliability checks:** Cronbach's α > 0.7 for multi-item measures
- **Manipulation checks:** Verify stress/load manipulations effective
