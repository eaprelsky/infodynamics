# Idea Description

I came up with an idea for a new discipline that could be called "Information Dynamics."

This is an analog of electronics, but describes the movement of information rather than electrical current.

I will examine information movement through people, but in a similar way one could consider information passing through cognitive agents, information systems, and all of these together.

Information flows, encounters a slow person, and gets stuck for a long time.

This is an element that creates inertia in information circuits, functionally analogous to an inductor coil.

Similarly, there is a person-resistor. For example, a person inclined to carefully filter information. They listen to a lot from others, but transmit only a small portion of it further. They have cognitive resistance.

A person-conductor transmits to others all the information that enters them.

Generators create new information. But they can have different voltage, meaning different abilities to spread their created information to many people.

Transformers step down or step up cognitive voltage, that is, they convert complex information into accessible form and vice versa. These are, for example, science popularizers, teachers, and so on.

Furthermore, there is a huge layer of the unexplored, related to the fact that information varies greatly in quality and content.

For example, information can have sentiment (emotional coloring).

Information can have timbre. Not good or bad, just different in sound, like how a cello differs from a vuvuzela.

Software development already deals with information systems engineering, that is, complex systems that transform information.

But Information Dynamics involves working with information at a different level. This is not work with data, not with their format and structure.

Rather, it's about studying information as a unique natural phenomenon.

We will be able to become acquainted with all the diversity of its properties when cognitive technologies become cheap and easily accessible, but in principle, there is room for research and theory building even now.

Application areas of Information Dynamics include corporate psychology and HR, education, sales, project management, public administration, and social engineering.
