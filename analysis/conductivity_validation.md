## 🧮 G_info Calculation

### **Implementation**
```python
def calculate_G_info_stanford(participant_data):
    """Calculate G_info from Stanford dataset measures"""
    
    # Attention selectivity (from flanker task)
    flanker_effect = participant_data["flanker_incongruent_rt"] - participant_data["flanker_congruent_rt"]
    attention_selectivity = max(0.1, 1.0 - (flanker_effect / 200.0))  # Normalize by 200ms
    
    # Working memory capacity (composite z-score)
    wm_tasks = ["nback_dprime", "operation_span", "reading_span"]
    wm_composite = np.mean([zscore(participant_data[task]) for task in wm_tasks])
    wm_capacity = max(0.1, 1.0 + wm_composite / 3.0)  # Convert to 0.1-2.0 range
    
    # Processing efficiency (speed-accuracy trade-off)
    processing_speed = 1.0 / participant_data["pattern_comparison_rt"] * 1000
    processing_accuracy = participant_data["pattern_comparison_accuracy"]
    processing_efficiency = processing_speed * processing_accuracy
    processing_efficiency_norm = min(2.0, processing_efficiency / 5.0)
    
    # Individual difference factors
    age = participant_data["age"]
    age_factor = max(0.5, 1.2 - 0.01 * max(0, age - 20))  # Age decline after 20
    
    education = participant_data["education_years"]
    education_factor = min(1.5, 0.8 + 0.05 * education)  # Education benefit
    
    # Combined G_info calculation
    G_info = (
        0.35 * attention_selectivity +
        0.35 * wm_capacity +
        0.30 * processing_efficiency_norm
    ) * age_factor * education_factor
    
    return max(0.1, min(10.0, G_info))
