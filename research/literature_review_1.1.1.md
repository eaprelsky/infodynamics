### üìñ Annotated Bibliography

#### 1. **Mitigating Societal Cognitive Overload in the Age of AI: Challenges and Directions**
**Author:** Salem Lahlou  
**Year:** 2025  
**Source:** arXiv:2504.19990  

**Abstract:** This work examines societal cognitive overload as a critical challenge in the AI era. The author investigates how AI exacerbates cognitive overload through various mechanisms: information spread, algorithmic manipulation, automation anxiety, and meaning erosion.

**Connection to Information Dynamics:** Directly related to the concept of "information resistance" - cognitive overload occurs when "information pressure" exceeds the system's processing capacity.

#### 2. **Cognitive Overload Attack: Prompt Injection for Long Context**
**Authors:** Bibek Upadhayay, Vahid Behzadan, Amin Karbasi  
**Year:** 2024  
**Source:** arXiv preprint  

**Abstract:** This study presents a new interpretation of in-context learning (ICL) through the lens of cognitive neuroscience. Authors apply principles of cognitive load theory to large language models and show how cognitive overload can be exploited.

**Connection to Information Dynamics:** Demonstrates practical application of "information inductance" and "cognitive resistance" concepts in AI systems.

#### 3. **Dealing with information overload: a comprehensive review**
**Authors:** Miriam Arnold, Mascha Goldschmitt, Thomas Rigotti  
**Year:** 2023  
**Source:** Frontiers in Psychology  

**Abstract:** Systematic review of measures for preventing and intervening in information overload. The study covers 87 works and proposes classification of interventions across five levels: information, personality, tasks and processes, organizational processes, information technologies.

**Connection to Information Dynamics:** Direct correspondence with our "information circuits" model - authors essentially describe different types of "information elements" and ways to manage "information flows."

#### 4. **Critical Ignoring as a Core Competence for Digital Citizens**
**Authors:** Anastasia Kozyreva, Sam Wineburg, Stephan Lewandowsky, Ralph Hertwig  
**Year:** 2022  
**Source:** Current Directions in Psychological Science  

**Abstract:** Introduces the concept of "critical ignoring" as a key competence for digital citizens. Authors propose three strategies: self-nudging, lateral reading, and "don't feed the trolls" heuristic.

**Connection to Information Dynamics:** Describes mechanisms of "information resistance" at the human level - how individuals can act as "information filters" and "resistors."

#### 5. **Cognitive Resonance Theory in Strategic Communication**
**Authors:** Marija Gombar, Maja Kri≈æanec Cvitkoviƒá  
**Year:** 2025  
**Source:** Open Access Library Journal  

**Abstract:** Presents a new theoretical framework for studying interactions between algorithmic personalization, emotional engagement, and echo chamber formation. The theory explains how algorithmically curated content contributes to cognitive alignment.

**Connection to Information Dynamics:** The concept of "cognitive resonance" is analogous to our notion of "information resonance" - a state where information is amplified in the system.

### üß© Identified Key Concepts

#### 1. **Cognitive Load**
- **Definition:** Amount of working memory resources used during mental task execution
- **Types:** Intrinsic, extraneous, and germane cognitive load
- **Connection to ID:** Direct analogy with "information resistance" in our model

#### 2. **Information Overload**
- **Definition:** State when information amount exceeds processing capacity
- **Mechanisms:** Related to limited cognitive system bandwidth
- **Connection to ID:** Corresponds to exceeding "information capacity" of circuit element

#### 3. **Critical Ignoring**
- **Definition:** Selective filtering and blocking of information for information environment control
- **Strategies:** Self-directed management, lateral reading, ignoring malicious actors
- **Connection to ID:** Describes operation of "information filters" and "resistors"

#### 4. **Cognitive Resonance**
- **Definition:** State of enhanced belief alignment through repeated exposure to emotionally charged content
- **Mechanism:** Creates self-reinforcing cycles of cognitive alignment
- **Connection to ID:** Analogous to "information resonance" in circuits

#### 5. **Information Pressure**
- **Definition:** Impact of information flow on cognitive resources
- **Factors:** Volume, speed, complexity, emotional load of information
- **Connection to ID:** Direct analog of "information voltage"

### üï≥Ô∏è Identified Research Gaps

1. **Lack of formal model for information flows:**
   - Existing theories describe separate aspects, but no unified mathematical model

2. **No quantitative metrics for "information pressure":**
   - Most research is qualitative or uses indirect indicators

3. **Insufficient work on "information transformers":**
   - Little research on how information transforms during transmission

4. **Lack of systems approach to information networks:**
   - Research focuses on individual elements, not systems as a whole

5. **No universal terminology:**
   - Different fields use different terms for similar concepts

### üéØ Conclusions for Information Dynamics

1. **Concept is valid:** Rich literature exists confirming basic ID principles
2. **Terminology needs unification:** Our electrical analogy can become unifying language
3. **Mathematical formalization is needed:** Absence of formal models is our opportunity
