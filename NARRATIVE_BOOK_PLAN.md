**What Works:**
- **Human drama openings** ("George Miller had a problem...")
- **Real-world stakes** (air traffic controllers dying, students failing)
- **Discovery progression** (problem ‚Üí investigation ‚Üí breakthrough ‚Üí implications)
- **Mathematical integration** (formulas feel natural within stories)
- **Electrical connections** (analogies emerge organically)
- **No academic structure** (zero lists, zero code, pure narrative)

**Structure Created:**
- Main overview + 6 compelling sub-sections
- Each researcher's story as separate engaging narrative
- Chronological discovery journey (1948‚Üí1988)
- Climactic synthesis revealing the complete electrical circuit

**Template Established:**
1. **Hook with human problem** (real stakes, immediate engagement)
2. **Investigation process** (how they approached the mystery)
3. **Breakthrough moment** (the "eureka!" discovery)
4. **Mathematical formulation** (presented naturally)
5. **Electrical connection** (organic analogy development)
6. **Modern validation** (neuroscience confirms the insight)
7. **Practical implications** (real-world applications)
8. **Interactive link** (hands-on exploration)
