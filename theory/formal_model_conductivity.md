## üéØ Objective

Establish a formal mathematical relationship between selective attention mechanisms and information conductivity (G_info) in cognitive systems, creating measurable variables that can be empirically validated.

---

## üß† Theoretical Foundation

### Core Hypothesis
**Information conductivity is directly proportional to selective attention capacity and inversely related to cognitive load.**

### Conceptual Bridge
- **Selective Attention** (Cognitive Psychology) ‚Üî **Information Conductivity** (Information Dynamics)
- **Attention Filter** (Broadbent) ‚Üî **Information Resistance** (R_info = 1/G_info)
- **Working Memory Capacity** (Baddeley) ‚Üî **Information Processing Rate** (V_info)

## üìê Mathematical Formalization

### Base Formula

```
G_info = f(WM, AS, M, E, PS) √ó Context_Modifier √ó Nonlinear_Scaling
```

Where:
- **WM** = Working Memory Capacity
- **AS** = Attention Selectivity  
- **M** = Motivation/Engagement
- **E** = Domain Expertise
- **PS** = Processing Speed
- **Context_Modifier** = Environmental factors
- **Nonlinear_Scaling** = Sigmoid transformation

## üî¨ Experimental Predictions

### Primary Hypotheses

1. **H1:** G_info correlates positively with working memory capacity (r > 0.6)
2. **H2:** G_info correlates positively with attention selectivity (r > 0.5)  
3. **H3:** High distraction contexts reduce G_info by 20-40%
4. **H4:** Expert users show 50-100% higher G_info in their domain

### Secondary Predictions

5. **H5:** Sigmoid relationship between cognitive resources and G_info
6. **H6:** Context effects interact with individual differences
7. **H7:** G_info predicts information processing speed (V_info)
8. **H8:** Fatigue shows strongest context effect (Œ≤ > 0.3)
