---

## üß† Theoretical Foundation

### Core Hypothesis
**Information capacity represents the cognitive system's ability to temporarily store and maintain information, analogous to electrical capacitance storing charge.**

### Conceptual Bridge
- **Working Memory** (Cognitive Psychology) ‚Üî **Information Storage** (C_info)

## üìê Mathematical Formalization

### Base Formula

```
C_info = Storage_Capacity √ó Retention_Factor √ó Access_Efficiency √ó Individual_Multipliers
```

Where:
- **Storage_Capacity** = Raw memory span and buffer size
- **Retention_Factor** = Ability to maintain information over time
- **Access_Efficiency** = Speed and accuracy of memory retrieval
- **Individual_Multipliers** = Personal cognitive characteristics
