**Development Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Based on:** Mental Chronometry (Donders), Belief Persistence (Anderson), Path Dependence (Arthur)

---

## 🎯 Objective

Establish a formal mathematical relationship between temporal processing delays, cognitive inertia, and information inductance (L_info), representing the system's resistance to rapid information changes.

---

## 🧠 Theoretical Foundation

### Core Hypothesis
**Information inductance represents temporal inertia in cognitive processing, manifesting as delays in information uptake and resistance to belief updating.**

### Conceptual Bridge
- **Processing Delays** (Mental Chronometry) ↔ **Temporal Inductance** (L_temporal)
- **Belief Persistence** (Social Psychology) ↔ **Cognitive Inductance** (L_cognitive)  
- **Institutional Memory** (Organization Theory) ↔ **Systemic Inductance** (L_systemic)

---

## 📐 Mathematical Formalization

### Base Formula

```
L_info = L_temporal + L_cognitive + L_systemic
```

Where:
- **L_temporal** = Processing speed delays and reaction time inertia
- **L_cognitive** = Belief updating resistance and anchoring effects
- **L_systemic** = Organizational/institutional change resistance

## 🔬 Experimental Predictions

### Primary Hypotheses

1. **H1:** L_info correlates negatively with processing speed (r < -0.6)
2. **H2:** L_info correlates positively with age (r > 0.4)  
3. **H3:** L_info correlates with belief updating difficulty (r > 0.5)

### Secondary Predictions

5. **H5:** Stress increases all components of L_info by 20-40%
6. **H6:** Expert domains show reduced L_cognitive for domain-specific beliefs
7. **H7:** L_info predicts time to adopt new information (r > 0.6)
8. **H8:** Cultural differences affect L_cognitive and L_systemic
